# P.-cinereus-imaging
Data and analysis of "gut fullness" relative to fruit fly consumption in Plethodon cinereus, as assessed with photography of live salamanders.

Data are contained in "fullnessdata_V2.csv" which includes columns for salamander #, treatment assignment, number of flies eaten in the previous week, observer, date, and "prop_full", the proportion of the gut that was determined to be full.

These data are analyzed and plotted with the file "fullness_analysis.R"
